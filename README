For the web interface copy the mmpc.php file to /var/www/

sudo cp /opt/mmpc/mmpc.php /var/www/

Files need to be writeable by your webserver user.

chmod a+w /opt/mmpc/mmpc_feeds.txt
chmod a+w /opt/mmpc/mmpc_oldfilestoadd.log


To run it every hour put this in your cron tab

0 * * * * /opt/mmpc/mmpc_start.pl


If you let miro run it will delete the files. Not sure why.
